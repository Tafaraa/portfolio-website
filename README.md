## 🔧 Performance Optimizations

This website implements several performance optimizations to achieve a perfect Lighthouse score:

1. **Code Splitting**: Separates vendor code from application code with granular chunk naming
2. **Lazy Loading**: Components and images load only when needed with intersection observer
3. **Font Optimization**: Variable fonts with font-display: swap for faster text rendering
4. **Image Optimization**: Advanced image loading with responsive sizing, lazy loading, and priority loading for LCP
5. **Enhanced Project Showcase**: Optimized carousel with efficient DOM updates, improved color contrast, and smooth transitions
6. **Minification**: All JavaScript and CSS is minified for production with Terser optimizations
7. **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code from the final bundle
8. **Caching Strategy**: Proper cache headers and asset naming for optimal resource caching
9. **Preloading**: Critical resources are preloaded for faster rendering
10. **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion
11. **Mobile Optimizations**: Adaptive loading based on device type with smaller resource thresholds for mobile
12. **CSS Modules**: Component-scoped CSS to prevent style conflicts and improve maintainability
